<h2>Boolean Comparisons</h2>
   <p>Boolean comparisons involve evaluating whether a statement is true or false. This is often used in programming to make decisions and control the flow of a program.</p>
   
<h2>Types of Boolean Comparisons</h2>
<ul>
        <li><strong>Equality Comparison:</strong> Checks if two values are equal using the equality operator (==).</li>
        <li><strong>Inequality Comparison:</strong> Checks if two values are not equal using the inequality operator (!=).</li>
        <li><strong>Greater Than Comparison:</strong> Determines if one value is greater than another using the greater-than operator (>).</li>
        <li><strong>Less Than Comparison:</strong> Determines if one value is less than another using the less-than operator (<).</li>
        <li><strong>Greater Than or Equal To Comparison:</strong> Checks if a value is greater than or equal to another using the greater-than-or-equal-toperator(>=)</li>
        <li><strong>Less Than or Equal To Comparison:</strong> Checks if a value is less than or equal to another using the less-than-or-equal-to operator (<=).</li>
        <li><strong>Logical Comparisons:</strong> Combine multiple boolean conditions using logical operators such as "AND" (&&) and "OR" (||).</li>
</ul>
          
<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
    <p>Logical operators are symbols used in programming to combine or manipulate boolean values. Common logical operators include <code>AND</code> (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>), <code>OR</code> (<code>||</code>), and <code>NOT</code> (<code>!</code>). They are used to create complex conditions and control flow in programming.</p>
    <h2>Types of Logical Operators</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AND Operator (&&):</strong> Returns true if both of its operands are true. It ensures that multiple conditions must all be true for an overall condition to be true.</li>
        <li><strong>OR Operator (||):</strong> Returns true if at least one of its operands is true. It is used when you want one or more conditions to be true for an overall condition to be true.</li>
        <li><strong>NOT Operator (!):</strong> Returns the opposite boolean value of its operand. It is used to negate a condition, turning true into false and false into true.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
  <h2>If-Else Statements</h2>
    <p>The <code>if-else</code> statement is used for making decisions in code. It allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.</p>
    
<h2>If-Else If Statements</h2>
    <p>The <code>if-else if</code> statement is an extension of the <code>if-else</code> construct. It allows you to check multiple conditions in a sequential manner and execute corresponding code blocks based on the first true condition encountered.</p>

 <h2>Switch Statements</h2>
    <p>A <code>switch</code> statement is a control structure in programming that allows you to select one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of an expression. It provides a way to streamline multiple conditional checks.</p>
